# Image Normalization and Aspect Ratio Improvements

## Summary
Fixed image normalization and aspect ratio issues in the apus app to ensure consistent image processing for both display and ML operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created UIImage+Processing Extension (`apus/Core/Extensions/UIImage+Processing.swift`)
- **`normalized()`**: Fixes image orientation issues from photo library
- **`resizedMaintainingAspectRatio(to:)`**: Resizes images while preserving aspect ratio
- **`preparedForProcessing(targetSize:)`**: Prepares images for ML processing with proper normalization
- **`preparedForDisplay()`**: Optimizes images for display with reasonable size limits
- **`displaySize(within:)`**: Calculates proper display size maintaining aspect ratio

### 2. Updated PreviewView (`apus/Features/Preview/Views/PreviewView.swift`)
- Added computed properties for `displayImage` and `processingImage`
- **Display**: Uses `preparedForDisplay()` for consistent UI rendering
- **Processing**: Uses `preparedForProcessing()` for classification and contour detection
- **History**: Still saves original image for user reference

### 3. Updated ImagePicker (`apus/Features/Camera/Views/ImagePicker.swift`)
- Images from photo library are now normalized immediately upon selection
- Fixes orientation issues before they reach the preview

### 4. Enhanced ZoomableImageView (`apus/Features/Preview/Views/ZoomableImageView.swift`)
- Improved aspect ratio handling with `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)`
- Added explicit frame constraints for better layout

## Benefits

### For Display
- ✅ Consistent image orientation regardless of source (camera vs photo library)
- ✅ Proper aspect ratio maintenance in all view states
- ✅ Optimized image sizes for better performance
- ✅ Better zoom and pan behavior

### For ML Processing
- ✅ Normalized images ensure consistent ML model input
- ✅ Proper aspect ratio maintenance prevents distortion
- ✅ No unnecessary padding that could affect classification accuracy
- ✅ Consistent preprocessing for both classification and object detection

### Performance
- ✅ Large images are resized to reasonable display sizes
- ✅ Processing images can be resized to optimal ML input sizes
- ✅ Memory usage optimization

## Technical Details

### Image Orientation Handling
The `normalized()` function ensures all images have `.up` orientation by:
1. Checking current orientation
2. Creating a graphics context if correction needed
3. Drawing the image with proper orientation
4. Returning the corrected image

### Aspect Ratio Preservation
The `resizedMaintainingAspectRatio(to:)` function:
1. Calculates scaling factors for width and height
2. Uses the smaller factor to ensure image fits within bounds
3. Maintains original aspect ratio
4. Uses `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` for efficient rendering

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Input**: Raw image from camera or photo library
2. **Normalization**: Fix orientation issues
3. **Display Path**: Optimize for UI display (max 2048px)
4. **Processing Path**: Prepare for ML (optional target size)
5. **Output**: Consistent, properly oriented images

## Testing
The implementation has been verified to:
- ✅ Compile successfully
- ✅ Handle various image orientations
- ✅ Maintain aspect ratios during resizing
- ✅ Work with both camera captures and photo library selections
- ✅ Provide consistent input to ML models
